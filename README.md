# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
Coding through machine learning from scratch.

Some algorithms I may explore are linear regression, logistic regression,
feed forward neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks for detection/localization/segmentation,
Recurrent Neural Networks using LSTM/GRUs, GANs and deep reinforcement learning.

Using courses materials, tutorials, code repositories and the internet as references.
