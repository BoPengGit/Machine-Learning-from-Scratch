# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
Coding through machine learning from scratch using tutorials and other code as references.

Some algorithms I may explore are linear regression, logistic regression, feed forward neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, 
Recurrent Neural Networks using LSTM/GRUs, GANs and deep reinforcement learning.

Some materials used as references to build the code are [Andrew Ng's machine learning course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Erik Linder-Nor√©n's ML-From-Scratch repo.](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch)
