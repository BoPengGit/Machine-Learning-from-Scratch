# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
Coding through machine learning from scratch using tutorials and other code as references.

Some algorithms I may explore are linear regression, logistic regression, feed forward neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, 
Recurrent Neural Networks using LSTM/GRUs, GANs and deep reinforcement learning.
